Order to do everything from very start is:
1) pdb id list in file id_list.txt. Every id in start of new line.
Line may have extra data after space. It will be ignored.
2) create_set.sh
3) prepare_set.sh
Now set is ready. Still Kd values sheet are bit mess.
4) fix Kd values with office in file Kd_ligand_table.csv manually
and save as Final_table3.csv. Columin 4 Kd values only as numbers.
Also fix train.sh to reflect file locations. 
5) main_train.sh
It makes final picture
